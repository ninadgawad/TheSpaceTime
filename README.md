# My Space Time Book

## INTRODUCTION

In past few centuries, humans have evolved rapidly and the knowledge we have acquired reflects our growth. The will to explore and the desire to experiment is what it makes the humans so special and unique. But a general and a very basic question has made humans ponder since the beginning “Who are we? How this so called infinite Universe came into existence? and Why”. Many great minds and philosophers have tried and some what succeeded in answering this question, but the quest for the complete and full solution is still on.

## Chapter 1: THE BEGINING 
Since the beginning different civilizations have depicted the cosmos in different ways and manner. At first people considered earth to be the center of the Universe and Planets and Stars to revolve around it, some believed that Earth is limitless. With invention of telescope by Galileo our vision of the cosmos improved.


The telescope helped us in identifying the group of Planets and natural satellites called **"Solar System"**, it comprises of 9 Planets (just found the 10th ‘U3132005’) and Planets have many satellites that revolve around them. Sun is in the center of the Solar System. While planets (Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto) revolve around it. As our knowledge about the cosmos increased we identified many objects in the Universe like Comets, Asteroids, Galaxies, Nebula’s and Black Holes.
The Newton’s Gravitational theory helped us understand how and why the planets revolve around the Sun and so do the natural Satellites around the planets. It helped us in knowing the basic principles of the Universe. With its implementation we could guide trajectory across the oceans and continents. This great theory begin with a common observation by Newton that an apple falls down from the tree, he pondered what made the apple fall down and in his quest to find the solution he came up with a theory (during year 1700) which proposed a force called Gravity which pulls every thing towards itself, it states that Gravity is directly proportional to the weight of the Object associated with it, hence the Earth attracts every object on it with a force which we now know is about 9.8m/s approx.
At the start of the 20th century German Scientist Sir Albert Einstein then proposed a radical paper that explained the relation with mass and Energy by his famous equation E=mc2 called the Theory of Relativity. This theory revolutionize our way of thinking about the space it considered space to be a 4-Dimensional (3 natural Dimension and 1time dimension) fabric which is affected by the Objects in it, heavy objects make the fabric bend and this is what we experience as Gravity. It also speculated that light would bend when it passed through a space if in path of a heavy object like Sun, Stars etc. later experiment during the Solar Eclipse proved this.

### GENERAL RELATIVITY
The General Relativity deals with large objects and considers Universe as a space time fabric which is geometric and predictable. This is basically the theory proposed by Sir Albert Einstein with little modification.

### QUANTUM PHYSICS
Quantum Physics on the other hand deal with minute or micro things like electrons, neutrons etc. which are totally unpredictable. 


### There are 4 types of forces:

* Gravity
* The Strong force
* Electromagnetic Force (ES)
* Weak Force (W)


### STRING THEORY

The String Theory states that everything is constituted of minute particles called strings unlike our popular belief of things being spherical in micro terms. It was suggested around 1968 by Gabrio Elathano accidentally while working on the Gamma function.
Was once called **“The Theory of Everything”**.
If Sun=Electron, Then String=Tree
Every string vibrates with different frequency and this gives each particle its unique property (It say’s that shape is everything).
Suggest 10-Dimension (3-Spacial Dimension, 1-Time Dimension, 6-Special Dimensions).Dimension is degree of freedom.
Multiple Dimensions can be explained by an example of an ant walking on a cable from a distant the cable seems to be a 1-D object but if we shrink to the size of the ant then it is two dimensional that is the ant can walk in two ways up-down or along the length, thus the dimensions are actually the degree of freedom from the observers perspective. Thus there a said to infinitely small dimension which are unable to seen in this Universe at such a large scale, but if we some how shrink billion-billionth of an atom then we will find this special dimensions around every point of the space time fabric. These extra dimensions maintain the cosmic symphony.

It has it share of anomalies; different scientist suggested different shape of strings and came up with multiple types of String theory 5 to be precise. This shook the very existence of the String Theory since it had multiple forms for a so called Theory of Everything.


### M-THEORY
Edwin Witten came up with new theory which he named the M-Theory. This theory remarkably combined the 5 versions of the String Theory into a single form and thus is the leading contender towards becoming the Theory of Everything. It added one more dimension to the String Theory making the total count of dimensions to 11-Dimensions.
It suggests Universe to be a Membrane or Brane.
